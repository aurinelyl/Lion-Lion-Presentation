 <article><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lion-lion-new-york">"Best kept secret in Manhattan? Possibly!! Theme: cute, speak easy type red light cocktail lounge in East Harlem" - Lisa M.</article><br></a>
 <article><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lion-lion-new-york">Don't be confused by the black curtain - the bar is open. Just slide it over and be transported from grungy NYC street to a bygone era (except for the Lite Brite behind the bar haha). This place is perfect for a date or just a nightcap and a chat with the trusty barkeep. The drinks are on point - inventive but not alienating. Try the Bartender's Special." - Kavari M.</article><br></a>
 <article><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lion-lion-new-york">"Show up, walk down the steps, slide the curtain over and get immersed with a beautiful setup. Some small booths for couples and a very sexy bar. I'd say they could probably fit around 8 people at the bar and maybe another 8 along the back wall. Legit setup."- Biru S.</article></br></a>

 <article><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lion-lion-new-york">"The music is sexy, yet relaxed. Drinks are tasty, yet strong, and these folks have giant ice cubes to make a drink properly.  Roger definitely knows how to take care of the crowd. I look forward to returning and getting better acquainted." - Mardory V.</article><br></a>

 <article><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lion-lion-new-york">"Love this place! Excellent bar, and very kind people. The drinks are tasty, and the prices reasonable--you can rock a beer and a shot for $5, or delicious cocktails with house-made fresh juices and sodas for $10-12 (or be like me, and have both). The bartenders are really talented and can really make you whatever--last night I ordered a "bedtime cocktail". I was not disappointed!" Eva S.</article>
